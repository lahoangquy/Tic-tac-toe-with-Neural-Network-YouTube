        "This project will show how adaptable neural networks can be, we will now attemp to use a neural network to learn the optimal move for Tic-Tac-Toe. We will approach this knowing that Tic-Tac-Toe is a deterministic game and that the optimal moves are already known.\n",
        "\n",
        "To train our model, we will use a list of board positions followed by the optimal response for a number of different boards. We can reduce the amount of boards to train on by considering only board position that are differnt with regard to symmetry. The non-identity transformations of a Tic-Tac-Toe board are a rotation (in either direction ) of 90 degress, 180 degrees and 270 degress a horizontal reflection and a vertical reflection. Given this idea, we will use a shortlist of boards with optimal move, apply 2 random transformations, and then feed that into our neural network for learning. \n",

        "Since Tic-Tac-Toe is a deterministic game, it is worth noting that whoever goes first should either win or draw. We will hope a model that can respond to our moves optimally and ultimately result in a raw.\n",
        "\n",
        "To check how our model is performing, we will do 2 things. The first check we will perform is to remove a position and an optimal move row from our training set. This will allow us to see if the neural network can generalize a move it has not seen before. The second way to evaluate our model is to actually play a game agasint it at the end"
